# GraphCMS UI Extension Demo for Bynder

[Join our Slack](https://slack.graphcms.com)

This UI Extension integrates GraphCMS with Bynder. It leverages Bynder's Compact View v2 component to browse assets from Bynder and use these within GraphCMS content entries.

## How to use

Deploy the code of this extension to Vercel or Netlify, or run locally (for example using [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)). Then, [add the UI extension to GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com/docs/ui-extensions/getting-started/installing-ui-extensions) using the URL to your index page as the URL for your extension.

To try out the extension first, you can get started with our hosted example. This should not be used for production use cases, as we don't guarantee the availability of this example: `https://gijshendrix.github.io/uix-demo-bynder/`

Follow the full guide on [working with GraphCMS UI extensions](https://graphcms.com/guides/working-with-ui-extensions).
